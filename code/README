I USED THE FILE GLOBAL_PATHS.PY TO MANAGE THE VARIOUS PATH USED INSIDE THE HOMEWORK.
MANY PATHS ARE NOT PRESENT IN THE RESOURCE FOLDER BECAUSE THE FILES ARE TOO BIG AND DIDN'T LOAD THEM.
TRAIN_AND_PREDICT_COLAB.IPYNB IS THE FILE USED ON COLAB TO DID TRAINING OF THE MODELS DEFINED IN MODEL.PY.
I DID ALSO THE PREDICT ON COLAB BECAUSE I HAD PROBLEMS WITH MY GPU, BECAUSE IT IS OLD. BUT I IMPLEMENTED
ALL THE PREDICT FUNCTIONS REQUIRED IN PREDICT.PY
I LEAVE THE MAIN IN THE PARSING.PY ONLY JUST TO SHOW YOU THE PIPELINE OF
THE FILES PARSING.

P.S :   IN THE PREDICT.PY, I DEFINE THE MODEL USING ELMO EMBEDDINGS FROM TENSORFLOW HUB.
	THE PROCESS CAN REQUIRES SEVERAL MINUTES TO DOWNLOADS THE MODULE!
